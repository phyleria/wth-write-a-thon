# 🧠 How to Write a Use Case Article

A use case article tells a story — it shows how a specific API can solve a real-world problem for a real user. This is not just about what the API does, but why it matters and how it can be applied.

This guide walks you through writing a compelling and technically sound use case article.

## 🧭 1. Define the Problem

Start with a relatable, real-world challenge. Help readers understand the context before the API comes into play.

Ask yourself:

- Who is the target user?
- What is their problem or goal?
- Why is it hard to solve without this API?

📌 Example:  
> "Imagine you're building a gig economy app that pays freelance designers across multiple countries..."

## 🔍 2. Introduce the API as the Solution

Once the reader understands the problem, introduce the Chimoney API endpoint as the tool that solves it.

- Explain which endpoint you're focusing on
- Highlight what it enables the user to do
- Briefly mention how it works (you’ll dive deeper in your tutorial)

📌 Example:  
> "Using Chimoney’s `multi-currency wallet transfer` endpoint, we can send payments to workers in their local currencies — instantly."

## 💡 3. Describe the Use Case in Detail

Be specific and grounded in a real-world flow:

- What does the user or system do first?
- When and how is the API called?
- What result does the user see or experience?

Break it into short sections or bullet points if needed.

📌 Example Outline:
- User submits payout request
- Platform validates balance
- Chimoney API is called with wallet and currency info
- Payment confirmation is displayed

## 🛠 4. Mention Supporting Features or Considerations

Show how the use case fits into a bigger picture:

- Are there any security/auth requirements?
- Is this use case scalable?
- How does it improve the product or user experience?

## 🧾 5. Optional: Visuals or Diagrams

If it helps, include a simple diagram or flowchart (Markdown, ASCII, or embed an image) showing the process.

📌 Example:

User ➡️ App ➡️ Chimoney API ➡️ Payment Processed ➡️ Confirmation

## ✅ Checklist Before You Submit

- [ ] I clearly explained the real-world problem
- [ ] I introduced the API as a relevant solution
- [ ] I described the use case in logical, actionable steps
- [ ] I made it easy to follow, even for someone new to the API
- [ ] My article is structured, concise, and relevant

## 💬 Final Tip

Avoid being too abstract. Think like a product builder or developer who needs to *see* how this API adds value in their project.
