# 🧑‍⚖️ Reviewer Guidelines

Thank you for supporting the Chimoney Write-a-Ton Challenge as a reviewer! This guide walks you through how to review participant submissions and what to look for in each deliverable.

## 🎯 Your Role

As a reviewer, you’ll:

- Review a participant’s PR (pull request)
- Check the completeness and quality of their submission
- Leave feedback via GitHub comments
- Approve the PR if all deliverables are complete
- Log your review in the shared scoring sheet

## 🧾 What to Review

Each submission will be in the `submissions/` folder under a subfolder like:

```
[endpoint]-[slackhandle]/
├── use-case.md
├── tutorial.md
└── setup.md
```

Review all three files.

### ✅ 1. Use Case Article (`use-case.md`)

- [ ] Is there a clear real-world use case described?
- [ ] Is the problem and audience clearly defined?
- [ ] Does it logically show how the API solves that problem?
- [ ] Is it readable, relevant, and technically sound?

### ✅ 2. Tutorial Guide (`tutorial.md`)

- [ ] Are the goals and steps clearly defined?
- [ ] Is the example request accurate and tested?
- [ ] Are responses and expected outcomes explained?
- [ ] Is the tutorial easy to follow?

### ✅ 3. Setup Guide (`setup.md`)

- [ ] Are the prerequisites clearly listed?
- [ ] Is authentication explained with examples?
- [ ] Can a new user follow this guide and make a successful API call?
- [ ] Is troubleshooting or error handling included?

## 🧮  Scoring

In the shared reviewer sheet, you’ll record:

- Participant name
- PR link
- Score (1–10)
- Short reviewer comment

You only need to approve the PR if it's complete and clear. If not, comment with required changes.

## 💡 Tips

- Be kind, constructive, and specific
- You don’t need to be a subject-matter expert — just a clear reader and technical communicator
- If unsure, ask the WriteTech Hub team before rejecting a submission.
