### Step 2: Choose your API endpoint
Pick ONE Chimoney API endpoint to focus on:
- [Create Interledger wallet address](https://api.chimoney.io/v0.2.4/api-docs/#/Interledger/post_v0_2_4_accounts_issue_wallet_address)
- [Multi-currency wallet transfer](https://api.chimoney.io/v0.2.4/api-docs/#/Interledger/post_v0_2_4_multicurrency_wallets_transfer)
- [Payout to Interledger wallet address](https://api.chimoney.io/v0.2.4/api-docs/#/Interledger/post_v0_2_4_payouts_interledger_wallet_address)

### Step 3: Create these three deliverables
You’ll create three separate documents (in Markdown) to showcase your technical writing skills:

1. **Use case article (`use-case.md`)**
   - Describe a real-world scenario where your chosen API endpoint is useful
   - Example: gig worker payouts, cross-border remittances

2. **Tutorial guide (`tutorial.md`)**
   - Step-by-step guide showing how to use the API endpoint in code
   - Include sample requests, responses, and clear explanations

3. **Setup guide (`setup.md`)**
   - Guide readers through authentication and environment setup
   - Ensure they can successfully call the API by the end

Your submission should be placed inside the `submissions/` folder using this format:

```
