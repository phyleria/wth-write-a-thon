# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to the 1st edition of the WriteTech Hub Write-a-Ton API Documentation Challenge in partnership with Chimoney!  
This document outlines how to contribute your submission and what’s required to participate successfully.

## Who can participate?

To take part in this challenge, you **must be a member of the Chimoney community**.  
If you're not yet a member, please join here: [https://discord.com/invite/TsyKnzT4qV](https://discord.com/invite/TsyKnzT4qV)

Once you join the Discord community, you’ll get access to:

We recommend also joining the [WriteTech Hub community](https://writetechhub.org/community). Being part of WriteTech Hub connects you with other technical writers, peer reviewers, and additional writing resources to help you excel in the challenge.

## What you’ll be submitting

You will select one Chimoney API endpoint and submit a folder containing three separate Markdown files:

```
submissions/
└── [endpoint]-[your-slackhandle]/
├── use-case.md
├── tutorial.md
└── setup.md
```

Each file represents a deliverable:

1. `use-case.md` — An article explaining a real-world application of the endpoint.
2. `tutorial.md` — A code-based tutorial with sample requests and explanations.
3. `setup.md` — A step-by-step guide for setting up the environment and calling the endpoint.

## Review & approval

A reviewer will:

- Check your three deliverables for clarity, structure, accuracy, and usefulness
